# Mars Wold
***A Minetest mod to generate a Marslike world***

## About

This project uses the Minetest Biomes API to create a world whose material composition and shape resemble features and resources thought currently to be on Mars. It was largely inspired by the [Moonrealm Mod](https://github.com/paramat/moonrealm)  

This mod is intended to be usable by all, but was created as part of a terraformation survival game based on the [Mars  Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson](https://www.kimstanleyrobinson.info/content/mars-trilogy)
